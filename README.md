**Project description:**
Dog breed classification, UT Dallas (BUAN 6V99 F20)
• Created a dog image classification model using transfer learning in deep neural network with an accuracy of ~95%
• Language: Python (Pytorch, NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn) 
• Platform: Google Colab (GPU)

**Results improved with:**
•	Data Augmentation
•	Transfer Learning (using pre-trained models)
•	Early stopping
•	Explored different initialization approaches 
•	Used Learning Rate Finder
•	Explored learning rate scheduler
•	Gradient Clipping (if exploding gradients)
•	Tried weights in loss function to account for imbalance in data.
